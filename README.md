I have chosen ReactJS, HTML and CSS3 for front end development, typescript for strong typechecking and webpack for module bundler.
Thought is to build a single and minified java script file to be included in the HTML. Eventually we will move to ReactJS Native,
so to maintain single javascript for both native os and for desktop.
